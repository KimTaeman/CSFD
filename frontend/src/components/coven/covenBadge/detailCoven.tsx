          <p>
            In Computer Science, we're taught to think logically. We work with clear inputs, follow
            structured flows, and expect predictable outcomes. But beneath every system, there's a
            layer you can't debug or compile. Something that doesn't follow instructions. That's
            where the real magic begins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of us do more than just write code, we open doors to new possibilities. We don't
            just analyze data, we start to see the future in it. And when we define variables,
            we're not just holding values, we're capturing potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            You're not just learning logic. You're learning to shape the invisible rules that guide
            everything around us.
          </p>
